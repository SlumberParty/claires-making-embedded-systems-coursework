## Glowing Cat Ears PCB

<p align="center">
Impurrtent context: Once upon a time I created light up costume cat ears and sold them at events, for years. Purrfessionally. They were very popular. 
At the time the very best lights I could find to use were small, coin-cell powered <a href="https://www.flashingblinkylights.com/multicolor-submersible-led-lights-for-special-events.html">"tea" lights.</a>
These lights were very good for this purpose. Waterproof, easy for non-technical folks to use, ran on commonly available batteries, bright,
long lasting, and most importantly, affordable and easy to source.

This upgrade features a commonly requested feature, the ability to react to ambient sound/music. It also upgrades the number of LEDs, using
a number of addressable RGB SMD LEDs, allowing for far more complex LED patterns. It has an accelerometer to react to the wearers movement,
changing colors/patterns with a tilt of the head, nodding etc. It has a button that will rotate through LED patterns/features, and is powered
by 2 CR2032 coin cell batteries, making sourcing power easy for a commercial user.
