# Week two exercise

**Brief:** For each board, look at the datasheet and getting started information for the board. Draw the
hardware block diagram for the board. For peripherals, note the communication paths (SPI, I2C,
etc).

Look through the datasheet for the processor and other documents. Answer these questions:

- What kind of processor is it?
- How much Flash and RAM does it have? Any other memory types?
- Does it have any special peripherals? (List 3-5 that you find interesting.)
- If it has an ADC, what are the features?
- How much does the board cost vs what the processor costs? Is the processor in stock
anywhere? (Try Digikey, Mouser, Octopart, Google, and so on.)

- Look at one application note for this board.

## Final project board, STM32F429I-DISC1:

- *Look at one application note for this board.*

I watched [this handy video](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/STM32F429I-DISC1/5731713), I think that counts?
